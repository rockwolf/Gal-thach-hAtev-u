\noindent I liked those lessons, but would've preferred the format to be in pdf or even better: epub. Putting the information from that website in a \LaTeX document, allows me to do just that.\\

\noindent Also check out http://www.moderngaulish.com, where I got the images from the title page. That website has all the latest information about the modern gaulish language.
