(\textit{Lesson 2: Personal Pronouns As Object})\\

\noindent In the second lesson you will learn how to use a pronoun when it is the object of a phrase with a verb.
\subsection{Personal pronouns as object of an active verb}

\noindent The object of a sentence is the thing to which something is being done. It is the receiving end of the action performed by the verb.\\

\noindent When personal pronouns are the object of a sentence they can take two different forms. The first form is identical to the form they take when they are the subject of a sentence, except for one. The subject of a sentence is the giving end of the action performed by the verb.

\begin{table}[H]

  \'{\i}s & they & \'{\i}s & them\\
\end{tabu}
\caption{Personal pronouns, as subject vs.\ as object}
\label{personal_pronouns_subject_object}
\end{table}

\noindent Only the third person plural pronoun differs: \'{\i}s instead of s\'{\i}.\\

\noindent These pronouns are used when they are the receiving end of an active verb. An active verb is a verb that performs the main action of a phrase. It will have a subject which will be performing the action. It will be in a form that indicates the time and the way the action is being performed.\\

\noindent V = verb\\
\noindent S = subject\\
\noindent O = object\\

\noindent In modern Gaulish a phrase has the standard order Verb-Subject-Object order. It is an aspect that is characteristic of the Celtic languages and is not common in English.\\

\noindent Using the verbs that were introduced in lesson 1 we can construct examples:\\
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabu}{ccc}
    \begin{tabu}{c|c}
    Gal\'{a}thach & English\\
    \toprule
    ap\'{\i}sa mi & I see
    \end{tabu}
    &
    \begin{tabu}{c}
    \\$\rightarrow$ 
    \end{tabu}
    &
    \begin{tabu}{c|c}
    Gal\'{a}thach & English\\
    \toprule
    ap\'{\i}sa mi ti & I see you
    \end{tabu}
\end{tabu}
\label{examples_verbs_vso}
\end{table}

\noindent In the phrase \textit{ap\'{\i}sa mi ti} the verb \textit{ap\'{\i}sa} comes first, the subject \textit{mi} comes second, and the object \textit{ti} comes third. This is indicated like this:\\

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabu}{ccc}
ap\'{\i}sa & mi & ti\\
V & S & O
\end{tabu}
\label{examples_verbs_vso_indication}
\end{table}

\noindent We can see that the verb \textit{ap\'{\i}sa} is an active verb because it is in the present tense: it has the present tense ending \textit{-a}.\\

\noindent Here are more examples:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabu}{c|c}
  \textbf{Gal\'{a}thach} & \textbf{English}\\
  \toprule
   g\'{a}ra \'{\i} mi & she calls me\\
   delgha \'{e} ni & he holds us\\
   gn\'{\i}a s\'{\i} s\'{u} & they know you (pl.)
\end{tabu}
\label{examples_verbs_vso_more_examples}
\end{table}

\noindent When the object pronoun starts with a vowel, such as \'{e}, \'{\i} and \'{\i}s, and they follow a subject pronoun, that object pronoun receives an extra letter \textit{ch-} at the start. This letter ch is pronounced like the -ch in the Scottish word ``loch''.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabu}{c|c}
  \textbf{Gal\'{a}thach} & \textbf{English}\\
  \toprule
  ap\'{\i}sa mi ch\'{\i} & I see her\\
  m\'{e}na mi ch\'{\i} & I think it\\
  gw\'{e}la \'{\i} ch\'{e} & she wants him\\
  \'{a}va \'{e} ch\'{\i} & he does it\\
  gn\'{\i}a s\'{u} ch\'{\i}s & you (pl.) know them\\
  g\'{a}ra \'{\i} ch\'{\i}s & she calls them
\end{tabu}
\label{examples_verbs_vso_extra_ch}
\end{table}

\subsection{Exercises}

\noindent Construct the following phrases with any of the following verbs:

\begin{quote}
prin (to buy), ber (to carry), br\'{\i}s (to break), \'{\i}vi (to drink), c\'{a}ra (to love), \'{a}v\'{o} (to do, to make), camwi (to bend, to curve), l\'{\i} (to lie down), gn\'{\i} (to know), ap\'{\i}s (to see), gw\'{e}l (to want), g\'{a}ra (to call)

\subsection{Personal pronouns as object of a verbal noun}

\noindent The verbal noun is the basic root form of the verb, called infinitive in English.\\

\noindent It is easiest to think of the verbal noun of modern Gaulish as the -ing form of the English verb.\\

\noindent E.g. can: to sing $\rightarrow$ can: singing\\
\noindent c\'{a}na mi ch\'{\i}: I sing it\\

\noindent When the personal pronouns are the object of a verbal noun, they take on a different form:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabu}{c|c}
  \textbf{Standard} & \textbf{As object of verbal noun}\\
  \toprule
  mi & im\'{\i}\\
  ti & ith\'{\i}\\
  \'{e} & ich\'{e}\\
  \'{\i} & ich\'{\i}\\
  ni & in\'{i}\\
  s\'{u} & is\'{u}\\
  \'{\i}s & ich\'{\i}s
\end{tabu}
\caption{Personal pronouns, as object of verbal noun}
\label{personal_pronouns_as_object_of_verbal_noun}
\end{table}

\noindent When a verbal noun is used in a phrase with an active verb it comes \textit{immediately after the subject}:\\

\noindent gw\'{e}la mi \textit{can}: I want \textit{to sing}\\

\noindent In this phrase the verbal noun is the object of the active verb:
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabu}{ccc}
  gw\'{e}la & mi & can\\
  V & S & O
\end{tabu}
\label{verbal_noun_object_of_active_verb}
\end{table}

\noindent If we think of the verbal noun as the -ing form of the verb, we could literally translate this as:
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabu}{cccc}
  want & I & singing & ($\rightarrow$ ``I want singing'')\\
  V & S & O & 
\end{tabu}
\label{verbal_noun_ing_form}
\end{table}

\noindent If we use a personal pronoun to be the object of the verbal noun we use the special form described above:
%\noindent gwéla mi can ichí: I want to sing it
%\noindent In this phrase the two words can ichí become the new object of the phrase.
%\noindent gwéla mi can ichí
%\noindent V       S    [O       ]
%\noindent The above phrase can be literally translated as I want singing of-it.
%\noindent The particle i- that the pronouns are attached to indicates possession of something:
%\noindent imí: of-me
%\noindent ithí: of-you
%\noindent iché: of-him
%\noindent ichí: of-her
%\noindent ichí: of-it
%\noindent iní: of-us
%\noindent isú: of-you pl.
%\noindent ichís: of-them
%\noindent The phrase can ichí translates as singing of-it. If we add an imaginary definite article [the] to the English version it makes sense:
%\noindent can ichí: [the] singing of-it &gt; gwéla mi can ichí: I want [the] singing of-it
