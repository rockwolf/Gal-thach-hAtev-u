In the fourteenth lesson, you will learn how the verbal system works in Gal\'{a}thach.

\subsection{Gwepchoprith: Conversation}
\subsubsection{Conversation}

Below is a conversation between two people. Gwirchan is a man and Benghal is a woman. Both are attested Gaulish names. The conversation shows you how the verbal system works.

(Gwirchan: Hey girl, come here!)

Benghal: N\'{e} chw\'{e}la mi d\'{\i}\'{a}i insin.
(Benghal: I don't want to come here.)

(Gwirchan: I think that you will want to see this.)

Benghal: Menth\'{u} ti p\'{e}th\'{e} \'{e}lu cin shin.
(Benghal: You have thought a lot of things before this.)

Gwirchan: Gars\'{\i}thu mi ti \'{\i}\'{o}n\'{e} \'{e}lu cin gl\'{u}ia ti.
(Gwirchan: I will have called you a lot of times before you hear.)

\subsection{Gwepchoprith: The verbal system}
\subsubsection{The verbal root/infinitive â€“ the imperative}

The verbal root or infinitive is the basic root form of the verb. It doesn't have any prefixes or suffixes. 

d\'{\i}\'{a}i: to come
gwel: to want

The imperative (giving a command) is the same as the verbal root. It is said in a commanding tone.

d\'{\i}\'{a}i insin! : come here!

There are seven different kinds of verbal roots, depending on their ending.

a) ending on -n, -r or -l

  gar & to call\\
  gwel & to want\\

\end{tabular}
\label{examples_ending_s}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{The present form}

The present form is made by giving the verbal root a suffix (a bit added at the end). This suffix or ending is â€“a. 

a) If the verbal root ends in -n, -r, -l or -s this ending -a is added at the end.

gwel: to want
> gw\'{e}la mi: I want

men: to think
> m\'{e}na mi: I think

gar: to call
> g\'{a}ra mi: I call

\'{a}pis: to see
> apisa mi: I see

b) If the verbal root ends in a vowel + -i the ending â€“a is added at the end.

d\'{\i}\'{a}i: to come
> di\'{a}ia mi: I come

cl\'{u}i: to hear
> cl\'{u}ia mi: I hear

c) If the verbal root ends in â€“a it doesnâ€™t change.

sp\'{a}: to say.
> sp\'{a} mi: I say

d) If the verbal root ends in a consonant + -i, -e or â€“o that â€“i, -e or â€“o is changed into an â€“a.

r\'{e}thi: to run
> r\'{e}tha mi: I run

delghe: to hold
> delgha mi: I hold

\'{a}v\'{o}: to do
> \'{a}va mi: I do

\subsubsection{The ongoing form}

The ongoing form is made by using the preposition â€œenâ€. It is put in front of the verbal root. It causes an initial consonant mutation on the verbal root.

\'{a}na: to breathe
> esi in Lithau en h\'{a}na: the Earth is breathing.

\subsubsection{The simple past form}

The simple past form is made by using the particle â€œr\'{e}â€. It is put in front of the verbal root. It causes an initial consonant mutation on the verbal root.

cl\'{u}i: to hear
> r\'{e} gl\'{u}i mi: I heard

sp\'{a}: to say
> r\'{e} â€˜p\'{a} ti neveth: you said nothing

\subsubsection{The completed past form}

The completed past form is made by giving the verbal root a suffix (an ending). 

a) verbal roots on n, r, l, a, e, o, and i not including â€“thi and -dhi

For these verbal roots the ending is â€“thu.

men > menthu mi: I have thought
gar > garthu mi: I have called
gwel > gwelthu mi: I have wanted
sp\'{a} > spathu mi: I have said
delghe > delgh\'{e}thu mi: I have held
\'{a}v\'{o} > av\'{o}thu mi: I have done
derchi > derch\'{\i}thu mi: I have looked

b) verbal roots on -thi, -dhi and -s

For these verbal roots the ending -i is changed into -\'{u}. This -\'{u} receives the emphasis.

s\'{e}dhi > sedh\'{u} mi: I have sat
r\'{e}thi > reth\'{u} mi: I have run
\'{a}pis > apis\'{u} mi: I have seen

6. The Simple Future Form

The simple future form is made by giving the verbal root a suffix (an ending).

a) all verbal roots except verbal roots on -s

For these verbal roots the ending is -s\'{\i}. The -\'{\i} receives the mephasis.

men > mens\'{\i} mi: I will think
gar > gars\'{\i} mi: I will call
gwel > gwels\'{\i} mi: I will want
sp\'{a} > spas\'{\i} mi: I will speak
delghe > delghes\'{\i} mi: I will hold
\'{a}v\'{o} > \'{a}vos\'{\i} mi: I will do
derchi > derchis\'{\i} mi: I will see
s\'{e}dhi > sedhis\'{\i} mi: I will sit
r\'{e}thi > rethis\'{\i} mi: I will run

b) verbal roots on -s

For these verbal roots the ending is -\'{\i}. The -\'{\i} receives the emphasis.

\'{a}pis > apis\'{\i} mi: I will see.

\subsubsection{The conditional future form}

The conditional future form is made by putting the particle â€œr\'{e}â€ in front of the simple future form. This particle â€œr\'{e}â€ causes initial consonant mutation on the verbal root.

men > r\'{e} wens\'{\i} mi: I would think
sp\'{a} > r\'{e} â€˜pas\'{\i} mi: I would say
derchi > r\'{e} dherchis\'{\i} mi: I would look
\'{a}pis > r\'{e} hapis\'{\i} mi: I would see

\subsubsection{The completed simple past form}

The completed simple past form is made by putting the particle \textit{r\'{e}} in front of the completed past form. This particle \textit{r\'{e}} causes initial consonant mutation on the verbal root.

gar > r\'{e} gharthu mi: I had called
delghe > r\'{e} dhelgh\'{e}thu mi: I had held
sedhi > r\'{e} shedh\'{u} mi: I had sat

\subsubsection{The completed simple future form}

The completed simple future form is made by adding the ending -thu to the simple future form.

gwel > gwels\'{\i}thu mi: I will have wanted
\'{a}v\'{o} > \'{a}vos\'{\i}thu mi: I will have done
r\'{e}thi > rethis\'{\i}thu mi: I will have run

\subsubsection{The completed conditional future form}

The completed conditional form is made by putting the particle \textit{r\'{e}} in front of the completed simple future form.

> r\'{e} chwelsithu mi: I would have wanted
> r\'{e} havos\'{\i}thu mi: I would have done
> r\'{e} rhethis\'{\i}thu mi: I would have run

\subsubsection{Ongoing past, future and conditional forms}

The ongoing form can be put in all the forms by putting the verb \textit{to be}in all the forms.
> b\'{u} mi en h\'{a}na: I was breathing
> b\'{\i} mi en h\'{a}na: I will be breathing
> \'{e}thu mi en h\'{a}na: I have been breathing
> bi\'{e}thu mi en h\'{a}na: I will have been breathing
> r\'{e} v\'{\i} mi en h\'{a}na: I would be breathing
> r\'{e} h\'{e}thu mi en h\'{a}na: I had been breathing
> r\'{e} vi\'{e}thu mi en h\'{a}na: I would have been breathing

\subsubsection{The \textit{may} form}

The \textit{may} form expresses a wish. It is made by putting the particle \textit{o} (â€œthatâ€) in front of the simple future form.

\'{a}pis: to see
> apis\'{\i} ti: you will see
> och apis\'{\i} ti: may you see

It can also be used with the completed future form.

> och apis\'{\i}thu ti: may you have seen

\subsubsection{The \textit{let us} form}

The \textit{let us} form indicates a command to a group of people including the speaker. It is made by using the imperative form (command) with the personal pronoun \textit{ni} (we).

derchi: to look
> derchi!: look!
> derchi ni!: let us look!

\subsubsection{The indirect command form}

The indirect command form expresses a command indirectly. It is constructed like a subordinate clause with \textit{o} (\textit{that}).

gw\'{e}la ti: you want
ap\'{\i}sa mi: I see
> gw\'{e}la ti och ap\'{\i}sa mi: you want that I see (= you want me to see)

\subsubsection{The impersonal form}

The impersonal form is made by adding the ending \textit{-or} to the end of the verbal root. It means a verb acts without a subject in a general way.

men: to think
> menor: one thinks / it is thought 

rinchi: to need
> rinchor: one needs / it is needed > \textit{it is necessary}

The impersonal form can be combined with all the forms of the verbs.

> r\'{e} rhinchor: it was necessary
> rinchorthu: it has been necessary
> r\'{e} rhinchorthu: it had been necessary
> rinchors\'{\i}: it will be necessary
> rinchors\'{\i}thu: it will have been necessary
> r\'{e} rhinchors\'{\i}: it would be necessary
> r\'{e} rhinchors\'{\i}thu: it would have been necessary
> rinchor!: be necessary!/ let it be necessary
> o rinchors\'{\i}: may it be necessary
> gw\'{e}la mi o rinchor: I want it to be necessary
