(\textit{Lesson 10: Possessive Pronouns \textemdash\ Demonstratives \textendash\ Locatives})\\

In the tenth lesson you will learn what possessive pronouns and demonstratives are, and how they work.

\subsection{Possessive Pronouns}

A possessive pronoun is a word that indicates possession of a thing. In Lesson 2 and 3 we learned two ways of indicating possession: by using the possession indicating particle \textit{i-}, and by putting two things next to each other, with or without the article between them. Using a possessive pronoun is the third way of indicating possession.\\

A possessive pronoun is a word that comes before an other word and that indicates possession of the second word: my, your, his, her etc.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Gal\'{a}thach} & \textbf{English}\\
  \cmidrule(lr){1-1}\cmidrule(lr){2-2}
  cun & dog\\
  m\'{o} & my\\
  m\'{o} gun & my dog\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{examples_possessive_pronoun}
\end{table}

The possessive pronoun causes mutation on the following word in most cases, but not for the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular feminine and not for the second person plural.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Gal\'{a}thach} & \textbf{English}\\
  \cmidrule(lr){1-1}\cmidrule(lr){2-2}
  m\'{o} & my\\
  t\'{o} & your\\
  \'{o} & his\\
  \'{o} & her\\
  n\'{o} & our\\
  s\'{o} & your (pl.)\\
  s\'{o} & their\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{summary_possessive_pronoun}
\end{table}

Because the third and the fourth and the sixth and the seven are the same, they are distinguished by the mutation: the third and the sixth cause mutation, the fourth and the seventh don't.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Gal\'{a}thach} & \textbf{English} & \textbf{Mutation}\\
  \cmidrule(lr){1-1}\cmidrule(lr){2-2}\cmidrule(lr){3-3}
  m\'{o} & my & mut.\\
  t\'{o} & your & mut.\\
  \'{o} & his & mut.\\
  \'{o} & her & \textbf{no} mut.\\
  n\'{o} & our & mut.\\
  s\'{o} & your (pl.) & \textbf{no} mut.\\
  s\'{o} & their & mut.\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{summary_possessive_pronoun_mutation}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Gal\'{a}thach} & \textbf{English}\\
  \cmidrule(lr){1-1}\cmidrule(lr){2-2}
  m\'{o} \textbf{g}un & my dog\\
  t\'{o} \textbf{g}un & your dog\\
  \'{o} \textbf{g}un & his dog\\
  \'{o} \textbf{c}un & her dog\\
  n\'{o} \textbf{g}un & our dog\\
  s\'{o} \textbf{c}un & your (pl.) dog\\
  s\'{o} \textbf{g}un & their dog\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{examples_possessive_pronoun_mutation}
\end{table}

Remember that possession can also be expressed with the particle \textit{i-}. In that case it uses the object pronouns, and they follow after the possessed thing.
%cun imí: a dog of mine
%cun ithí: a dog of yours
%cun iché: a dog of his
%cun ichí: a dog of hers
%cun iní: a dog of ours
%cun isú: a dog of yours (pl.)
%cun ichís: a dog of theirs

\subsection{Demonstratives}

A demonstrative is a word that indicates another word: this, that, those, these.\\
In Gal\'{a}thach the demonstratives have two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{the article \textit{in} before the word}
\item{the words \textit{sin} or \textit{s\'{e}} hyphenated to the end of the word}
\end{enumerate}

%cun: dog
%&gt; in cun-sin: this dog
%&gt; in cun-sé: that dog

If the word is feminine the article causes mutation.
%cunis: bitch
%&gt; in gunis-sin: this bitch
%&gt; in gunis-sé: that bitch

If the word is plural the article and the demonstratives stay the same.
%in cúné-sin: these dogs
%in gunísé-sé: those bitches
