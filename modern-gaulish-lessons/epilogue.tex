\textbf{Epilogue}\\
\bigskip
You have reached the end of this series of lessons for Gal\'{a}thach, the modern Gaulish language. Everything you need to know to be able to start using the language has now been explained. The lessons will provide an ongoing reference work to help you continue to improve in the language. It is hoped that you will join the small but slowly and steadily growing international community of speakers of this rejuvenated and revived old Celtic language.
