Lesson 17 In Da Tei

Trélaváru / Translation:

“My house is more beautiful than yours.”

“It is not. My house is bigger than yours.”

“It is. But your house is shit.”

\subsection{Conversation}

This is a dialogue between two men, Anerghu (The Very Red One) and Bochu (The Mouth).

Anerghu: Esi mó déi téi tech.
A: My house is a beautiful house.

Bochu: Esi í, in chwír. Éithr esi mó déi imí gwer dech.
B: Yes, it is. But my house [of-me] is more beautiful.

A: Né hesi, esi tó déi co dech co in ími, éithr né chwer dech.
A: No, your house is as beautiful as mine [the of-me], but not more beautiful.

B: Mi-esi comóinan, esi ti ancherth. Esi mó déi imí in téi techam.
B: I’m sorry, you are wrong. My house is the most beautiful house.

A: Ti-esi tó ben en in nemúé. Né hesi tó déi téi bithwír cotham, esi í in hónach téial.
A: You are deluded [your head is in the clouds]. Your house is not even a real house, it’s only a shack [houselet].

B: Bú mó déi in téi cin o bú carníthu.
B: My house was the first house that was built.

A: Galsí í bis certh o bú mó déi in téi cíal o bú carníthu, éithr esi í gwer dhái élu co in ithí.
A: My house might have been the second house that was built, but it is much better than yours [the of-you].

B: Éithr carnisí mi téi tríthu, ach bí í gwer dhái athé.
B: But I will build a third house, and it will be better again.

A: Surathu adhith. Cansóithisí mi aven dech, ach ton anthasí mi in colaváru duchwís sin ach techisí mi. On, dá, trí …
A: Good luck. I will count to ten, and then I will finish this stupid conversation and walk away. One, two, three, …

B: Ton gwerthisí mi in téié pethuar ach pimpeth en dhuné.
B: Then the fourth and fifth houses I will turn into fortresses.

A: … pethr, pimp, swech … [ádha é ó visé en ó dhachlus]
A: … four, five, six … [puts his fingers in his ears]

B: Ton, bí in téié swechweth, séithweth ach óithweth bóthéié ri mó gwochon-pimp ép …
B: Then the sixth, seventh and eighth houses will be stables for my twenty-five horses …

A: … séith, óith …
A: … seven, eight …

B: … en in téi nameth delghesí mi mo dachwochon-tridhech cun sonithi …
B: … in the nineth house I will keep my fifty-three hunting dogs …

A: … ná …
A: … nine …

B: … ach bí in téi dechweth téi’churu, pémái delghesí mi mó trichwochon-pimdhech tun u guru.
B: … and the tenth house will be a pub, where I will keep my seventy-five barrels of beer.

A: Á! Pérí né a ‘páthu ti sé in govíon. Ái ni a ghávi curu! Tó chwerthan a dioprithi!
A: Ah! Why didn’t you say that immediately! Let’s go for a beer! Your turn to pay!

Anerghu < Andergus, “the very red one”, attested.
Bochu < Bocco, “the mouth”, attested.

\subsection{Comparison}

There are three steps of comparison in Galáthach.

\subsubsection{one thing is as good as another thing}

To express this the word “co”, meaning “as, like, same, similar” is used two times. “Co” causes Initial Consonant Mutation.

tech: beautiful
canech: gold
\begin{quote}
esi in téi co dech co ganech: the house is as beautiful as gold
\end{quote}

áchu: fast
lócheth: lightning

\begin{quote}
esi in ép co háchu co lhócheth: the horse is as fast as lightning
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{one thing is better than another thing}

To express this the word “gwer”, meaning “on, over” is used. It causes ICM. It can be used by itself, without reference to other things.

esi in téi-sin gwer dech: this house is more beautiful.
esi in ép-sin gwer háchu: this horse is faster

It can also be used in combination with the word “co” to refer to other things.

esi in téi-sin gwer dech co ganech: this house is more beautiful than gold
esi in ép-sin gwer hachu co lhócheth: this horse is faster than lightning.

\subsubsection{a thing is the best}

To express this the suffix –am is used.

esi in téi-sin techam: this house is most beautiful. [this house is the most beautiful one]
esi in ép-sin achúam: this horse is fastest. [this horse is the fastest one]

This system is also used in the comparitive value system described in lesson 15:

dái – gwer dhái– dáisam > good – better – best
mes – gwer wes – mesam > bad – worse – worst

Examples from the conversation above:

    Éithr esi mó déi imí gwer dech: but my house [of-me] is more beautiful.
> in this sentence the word “imí”, meaning “of-me”, “mine”, is added to give emphasis to the statement.

    Né hesi, esi tó déi co dech co in ími: No, your house is as beautiful as mine.
> in this sentence the phrase “né hesi”, meaning “[it] is not” is used to say “no”.
> the phrase “in imí”, meaning “the of-me” is used to say “mine”. It is used to refer to a thing without repeating it. It is the equivalent of English “mine”and French “le mien”.

    Esi mó déi imí in téi techam: my house is the most beautiful house.
> in this sentence the phrase “in téi techam” means “the most beautiful house. The word “techam”, meaning “most beautiful”, is an adjective and therefore follows the noun it says something about.

\subsection{Diminutive}

The diminutive in Galáthach is formed with the suffix –al.

Example from the conversation above:

Né hesi tó déi téi bithwír cotham, esi í in hónach téial: your house is not even a real house, it is only a shack.

téi: house
> téial: shack [little house]

It is often used for words that describe a “smaller version” of something:

ép: horse
> épal: foal

gnath: child
> gnathal: baby

\subsection{Numbers}
\subsubsection{cardinal numbers}

The cardinal numbers of Galáthach are listed throughout the conversation above. A person counts to ten:
> on, dá, trí, pethr, pimp, swech, séith, óith, ná, dech
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

The numbers from one to twenty form the basis for the formation of all other numbers.
> onech, dádhech, trídhech, pethrdhech, pimdhech,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,  fifteen
> swechdhech, séidhech, óidhech, nádhech, gwochon
sixteen,  seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty

After twenty the numbering starts again:
> gwochon-on, gwochon-dá, gwochon-trí, gwochon-pethr, gwochon-pimp
twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five
> gwochon-swech, gwochon-séith, gwochon-óith, gwochon-ná, gwochon-dech
twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

The word thirty is made up of twenty + ten: gwochon-dech [twenty-ten].

The numbers from thirty to forty are made by combining twenty with the numbers eleven to nineteen:
> gwochon-onech, gwochon-dádhech, gwochon-tridhech, gwochon-pethrdech, gwochon-pimdhech
thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-four, thirty-four, thirty-five

and so on.

The number forty is made up of the number two + twenty: dáchwochon [two-twenty].

Then the pattern starts again. The number fifty is two + twenty + ten: dachwochon-dech [two-twenty-ten].

The numbers from fifty to sixty are made by combining the numbers two-twenty with the numbers eleven to nineteen:
> dáchwochon-onech, dáchochon-dadhech, dáchochon-trídhech …
fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty-three
[two-twenty-eleven,   two-twenty-twelve,  two-twenty-thirteen …]

The number sixty is made up of the number three + twenty: trichwochon.

Then the pattern starts again.

The number forty is made up of the number four + twenty: pethrchwochon

Then the pattern starts again.

The number one hundred is “can”.

The number one thousand is “mil”.

\subsubsection{ordinal numbers}

The ordinal numbers are listed throughout the conversation above. The ordinal numbers one to five (first to fifth) are irregular.

cin: first
cíal: second
tríthu: third
pethúar: fourth
pimpeth: fifth

All other ordinal numbers except ones ending on “ nine” are formed regularly by adding the suffix “–weth” to the cardinal number.

swechweth: sixth
séithweth: seventh
óithweth: eighth
dechweth: tenth
onechweth: eleventh
dadhechweth: twelfth
pimdhechweth: fifteenth
swechdhechweth: sixteenth
nádhechweth: nineteenth
gwochonweth: twentieth
dachwochonweth: fortieth
trichwochonweth: sixtieth
pethrchwochonweth: eightieth
canweth: hundredth
milweth: thousandth

Ordinal numbers ending on “nine” are formed by adding the suffix “-meth” to the cardinal number.

námeth: nineth
gwochon-námeth: twenty-nineth
dachwochon-námeth: forty-nineth
trichwochon-námeth: sixty-nineth
