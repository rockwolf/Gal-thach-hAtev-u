\section{Menghavan 9: Gwepr\'{a}i\'{e}}
(\textit{Lesson 9: Prepositions})\\

In the nineth lesson you will learn about prepositions. A preposition is a word that provides information about the location, situation or position of something.

\subsection{Prepositions}

All prepositions in modern Gaulish cause initial consonant mutation on the word that follows them.
%esi: is
%\'{e}p: horse
%anel: underneath
%pren: tree
%&gt; esi \'{e}p anel \textbf{b}ren: there is a horse underneath a tree (litt. “a horse is underneath a tree”)
%s\'{e}dhi: sit
%gwir: man
%ur: against
%carch: rock
%&gt; s\'{e}dha gwir ur <strong>g</strong>arch: a man sits against a rock
%esi: is
%gwolth: hair
%en: in
%iuth: soup
%&gt; esi gwolth en <strong>ch</strong>’iuth: there is a hair in a soup
%esi: am
%mi: I
%e: from
%t\'{o}th: people
%r\'{i}u: free
%&gt; esi mi e <strong>d</strong>\'{o}th r\'{i}u: I am from a free people
%\'{a}ia: go
%\'{i}: she
%a: to
%tr\'{a}ith: beach
%&gt; \'{a}ia \'{i} a \textbf{d}r\'{a}ith: she goes to a beach
Prepositions do not cause mutations on the article \textit{in} or on possessive pronouns.
%&gt; esi \'{e}p gw\'{o} \textbf{i}n pren
%&gt; esi gwolth en \textbf{m}\'{o} ch'iuth: there is a hair in my soup

\subsubsection{With Personal Pronouns}
Prepositions fuse with personal pronouns:
%can: with
%mi: I
%&gt; canim: with me
%gwer: on
%ti: you
%&gt; gwerith: on you
%nes: near
%ni: we
%&gt; nesin: near us

\subsection{Patterns}

Prepositions fuse with personal pronouns according to regular patterns. There are four different categories for these patterns.

\subsubsection{Prepositions Ending In Consonants}
These are:
% TODO: make a table: gal\'{a}thach english  for all of them
%can, ar, ern, ur, cin, \'{o}s, gwer, en, tar, am, \'{e}r, \'{e}chan, enther, uchel, anel
% (with, before, behind, against, after, on, in, through, about, around, without, between, above, below)

These take the following endings:
\begin{quote}
\textit{-im, -ith, -\'{e}, -\'{i}, -in, -s\'{u}, -\'{i}s}
\end{quote}

%canim: with me
%canith: with you
%can\'{e}: with him
%can\'{i}: with her
%canin: with us
%cans\'{u}: with you (pl.)
%can\'{i}s: with them

The emphasis in these forms falls on the last syllable:
\begin{quote}
can\textbf{im}: with \textbf{me}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Prepositions Ending In Vowels}
These are:
% TODO: make table with gal\'{a}thach english for all of them
%ri, di, tr\'{e}, co, \'{e}ithra, an\'{o}, ech\'{o} (for, off, across, than/as, beyond, inside, outside)

These take the following endings:
\begin{quote}
\textit{-em, -eth, -ch\'{e}, -ch\'{i}, -en, -s\'{u}, -ch\'{i}s}
\end{quote}

%riem: for me
%rieth: for you
%rich\'{e}: for him
%rich\'{i}: for her
%rien: for us
%ris\'{u}: for you (pl.)
%rich\'{i}s: for them

The preposition \textit{tr\'{e}} takes a special form of this. It adds an \textit{-i-} to the front of the 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2\textsuperscript{nd} and 5\textsuperscript{th} form:
\begin{quote}
\textit{-\textbf{i}em, -\textbf{i}eth, -ch\'{e}, -ch\'{\i}, -\textbf{i}en, -s\'{u}, -ch\'{\i}s}
\end{quote}

%tr\'{e}iem: across me
%tr\'{e}ieth: across you
%tr\'{e}ch\'{e}: across him
%tr\'{e}ch\'{i}: across her
%tr\'{e}ien: across us
%tr\'{e}s\'{u}: across you (pl.)
%tr\'{e}ch\'{i}s: across them
%<ol start="3">

\subsubsection{Prepositions Consisting Of Only One Vowel}
% TODO: make a table with gal\'{a}thach, english
These are: a, e, u, i (to, from, of [with quantity], of [property])

These take the following endings:
\begin{quote}
\textit{-im, -ith, -\'{e}, -\'{i}, -in, -\'{u}, -\'{i}s}
\end{quote}

Also, the root form of the preposition changes:
%a &gt; adh-
%e &gt; ech-
%u &gt; uch-
%i &gt; ich-
%adhim: to me
%adhith: to you
%adh\'{e}: to him
%adh\'{i}: to her
%adhin: to us
%adh\'{u}: to you (pl.)
%adh\'{i}s: to them

\subsubsection{Prepositions Ending On \textit{-u}}
% TODO: make table with gal\'{a}thach, english
These are:
%au, didh\'{\i}u (away from, outside)}

These prepositions don't fuse with personal pronouns. The personal pronouns follow after them without changing. The object pronouns are used.
%au mi: away from me
%au ti: away from you
%au ch\'{e}: away from him
%au ch\'{i}: away from her
%au ni: away from us
%au s\'{u}: away from you (pl.)
%au ch\'{i}s: away from them
