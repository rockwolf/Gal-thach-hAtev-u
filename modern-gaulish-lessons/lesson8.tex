\section{Menghavan 8: Rivrethr\'{e}}
(\textit{Lesson 8: Adverbs})\\

In the eighth lesson you will learn about adverbs.

\subsection{Adverbs}

An adverb is a word that describes a quality or a characteristic of a verbal action.\\
English examples are: quickly, quietly, calmly, naturally, normally. In English they are usually formed with the suffix \textit{-ly}.\\
In Gal\'{a}thach adverbs are formed by placing the particle \textit{in} in front of an adjective. The adjective undergoes mutation of its initial consonant.
