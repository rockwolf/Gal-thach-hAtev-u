The information in this document, was retrieved from \textit{https://moderngaulishlessons.wordpress.com/modern-gaulish-lessons-in-english/}\\
\bigskip
I liked those lessons, but would've preferred the format to be in pdf or even better: epub. Putting the information from that website in a \LaTeX\ document, allows me to create the formats I desire. The content is transcribed, almost word for word. I may have made small changes related to punctuation marks, layout and for clarification, minor additions to the content itself.\\
\bigskip
The website \textit{http://www.moderngaulish.com}, is also worth checking out. There, you can find all the latest information about the Modern Gaulish language.\\
\bigskip
There is also an active facebook group for the Modern Gaulish language, which you can find at the following url: \textit{https://www.facebook.com/groups/moderngaulishlanguage/}.\\It's a good place to ask questions about the language.
