A: Hey, I’m interested in time. Spending time with you, specifically. 
M: Ah yes, time is my specialty.
A: Is it really?
M: It is. Let me tell you how it works ...

A: All right.
M: Time starts with seconds, which make up minutes, which make up hours.
A: That’s right.
M: Explaining this will only take half an hour.
A: Fair enough.
M: There are 12 hours in a day, and 12 hours in a night, at least at the equinoxes.
A: Exactly.
M: A whole 24 hour period is called a “day period”.
A: It is.
M: A day period consists of a dawn, a morning, a midday, an afternoon, an evening, and a midnight.
A: Fair enough. I particularly like the night. What about you?
M: I prefer the day.
A: I see. What are you doing tomorrow?
M: The same thing I did yesterday and the day before yesterday.
A: And what was that?
M: I will be cleaning my collection of severed heads.
A: Of course. And the day after tomorrow?
M: The same.
A: Right.
M: Now, seven days make up a week.
A: Really?
M: And the last two days are called the weekend.
A: Ah yes, since you mention it ... what are you doing this weekend?
M: I’ll be washing my hair in horsepiss and lime.
A: Right.
M: I did it today and I’ll do it again tonight.

A: Charming.
M: So, there are four weeks in a month.
A: There are.
M: And there are three months in a season.
A: Is there?
M: There is. And there are four seasons in one year: spring, summer, autumn, winter.
A: Sounds about right.
M: And we celebrate special events throughout the year. Such as birthdays.
A: That’s right! When’s your birthday and what will you be doing?
M: It was last week.
A: Ah.
M: At times we have three-night and ten-night celebrations, such as at the solstices and equinoxes.
A: Exactly! What will you be doing then?
M: I will be dancing around the fire in the nude ...
A: Ah! Now we’re talking ...
M: ... with all my girlfriends ...
A: Great!
M: ... wielding very sharp swords ...
A: You do?
M: ... and we ritually slice up sausages.
A: I see.
M: Then, the years are gathered in generations ...
A: What are they?
M: That’s from your birth to the birth of your first child.
A: Ah, now, on the subject of babies ...
M: And then the years are counted in ages.

A: What’s an age?
M: It is thirty years, or six calendar completions.
A: Right.
M: Now, an age ...
A: Yes?
M: ... that’s exactly how long you’re going to have to wait before you ever get your hands on me.
