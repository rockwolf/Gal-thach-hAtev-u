(\textit{Lesson 8: Adverbs})\\

In the eighth lesson you will learn about adverbs.

\subsection{Adverbs}

An adverb is a word that describes a quality or a characteristic of a verbal action.\\
English examples are: quickly, quietly, calmly, naturally, normally. In English they are usually formed with the suffix \textit{-ly}\\.
In Gal\'{a}thach adverbs are formed by placing the particle \textit{in} in front of an adjective. The adjective undergoes mutation of its initial consonant.
%áchu: quick
%in háchu: quickly
%áva mi chí: I do it
%&gt; áva mi chí in háchu: I do it quickly
%tau: quiet
%in dau: quietly
%spá í chí: she says it
%&gt; spá í chí in dau: she says it quietly
%aram: calm
%in haram: calm
%réna in avon: the river flows
%&gt; réna in avon in haram: the river flows calmly
%amvíthach: natural
%in hamvíthach: naturally
%gwóra cráré mel: bees produce honey
%&gt; gwóra cráré mel in hamvíthach
%suves: normal
%in shuves: normally
%né chwergha í co shé: she doesn’t act like that
%&gt; né chwergha í co shé in shuves

\subsubsection{Position Of The Adverb}

%Gwóra cráré mel in hamvíthach // “produce bees honey naturally”
