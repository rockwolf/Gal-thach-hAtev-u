\noindent The website \textit{http://www.moderngaulish.com}, is also worth checking out. There, you can find all the latest information about the Modern Gaulish language.\\

\noindent There is also an active facebook group for the Modern Gaulish language, which you can find at the following url: \textit{https://www.facebook.com/groups/moderngaulishlanguage/}. It's a good place to ask questions about the language.
