(\textit{Lesson 10: Possessive Pronouns \textemdash\ Demonstratives \textendash\ Locatives})\\

In the tenth lesson you will learn what possessive pronouns and demonstratives are, and how they work.

\subsection{Possessive Pronouns}

A possessive pronoun is a word that indicates possession of a thing. In Lesson 2 and 3 we learned two ways of indicating possession: by using the possession indicating particle \textit{i-}, and by putting two things next to each other, with or without the article between them. Using a possessive pronoun is the third way of indicating possession.\\

A possessive pronoun is a word that comes before an other word and that indicates possession of the second word: my, your, his, her etc.
%cun: dog
%mó: my
%&gt; mó gun: my dog

The possessive pronoun causes mutation on the following word in most cases, but not for the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular feminine and not for the second person plural.
%mó: my
%tó: your
%ó: his
%ó: her
%nó: our
%só: your (pl.)
%só: their

Because the third and the fourth and the sixth and the seven are the same, they are distinguished by the mutation: the third and the sixth cause mutation, the fourth and the seventh don't.
%mó (my): mut.
%tó (your): mut.
%ó (his): mut.
%ó (her): <strong>no</strong> mut.
%nó (our): mut.
%só (your pl.): <strong>no</strong> mut.
%só (their): mut.
%mó <strong>g</strong>un: my dog
%tó <strong>g</strong>un: your dog
%ó <strong>g</strong>un: his dog
%ó <strong>c</strong>un: her dog
%nó <strong>g</strong>un: our dog
%só <strong>c</strong>un: your (pl.) dog
%só <strong>g</strong>un: their dog

Remember that possession can also be expressed with the particle \textit{i-}. In that case it uses the object pronouns, and they follow after the possessed thing.
%cun imí: a dog of mine
%cun ithí: a dog of yours
%cun iché: a dog of his
%cun ichí: a dog of hers
%cun iní: a dog of ours
%cun isú: a dog of yours (pl.)
%cun ichís: a dog of theirs

\subsection{Demonstratives}

A demonstrative is a word that indicates another word: this, that, those, these.\\
In Gal\'{a}thach the demonstratives have two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{the article \textit{in} before the word}
\item{the words \textit{sin} or \textit{s\'{e}} hyphenated to the end of the word}
\end{enumerate}

%cun: dog
%&gt; in cun-sin: this dog
%&gt; in cun-sé: that dog

If the word is feminine the article causes mutation.
%cunis: bitch
%&gt; in gunis-sin: this bitch
%&gt; in gunis-sé: that bitch

If the word is plural the article and the demonstratives stay the same.
%in cúné-sin: these dogs
%in gunísé-sé: those bitches
