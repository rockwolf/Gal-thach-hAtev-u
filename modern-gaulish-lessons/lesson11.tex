\section{Menghavan 11: Colav\'{a}ru \textemdash\ M\'{e}su P\'{e}thach \textendash\ Inchoran Chwoghn\'{\i}thach}
(\textit{Lesson 11: Conversation \textemdash\ Interrogative Mode \textendash\ Subordinate Clause})\\

In the eleventh lesson you will learn how to construct a question, and how to construct sentences within sentences.

\subsection{Conversation}

Below is a conversation between two people. Bren is a man, Chiom\'{a}ra is a woman. Both are traditional Gaulish names. Bren was the leader of the attack on Delphi in 279 BCE, Chiom\'{a}ra was a woman from Galatia. This conversation shows you how questions are constructed.

\subsection{Colav\'{a}ru – Tr\'{e}lav\'{a}ru}
(Conversation – Translation)

Bren: Di wath. P\'{e} gaman a hesi ti?
(Bren: Good day. How are you?)

Chiom\'{a}ra: Esi mi in rh\'{e} dh\'{a}i, br\'{a}thu. Ach ti-s\'{u}\'{e}?
(Chiomara: I am very well, thank you. And yourself?)

Bren: Esi mi in dh\'{a}i c\'{o}\'{e}th, br\'{a}thu. A ghn\'{\i}a ti o ti-esi pen r\'{e} dech?
(Bren: I am well too, thank you. Do you know that you have a beautiful head?)

Chiom\'{a}ra: Gn\'{\i}a mi &#8230; p\'{e} a chw\'{e}la ti?
(Chiomara: I know &#8230; what do you want?)

Bren: A gh\'{a}la mi b\'{e} ich\'{\i} a brenuchi ich\'{\i} gwer m\'{o} sh\'{e}dhl’\'{e}p?
(Bren: Can I cut if [off] to hang it on my saddle?)

Chiom\'{a}ra: Conechughri!
(Chiom\'{a}ra: Fuck off!)

\subsection{Vocabulary}

p\'{e}: what (causes ICM on following word)
caman: road, way > p\'{e} gaman: how

d\'{\i}: day
good
> d\'{\i} wath: good day (ICM because “d\'{\i}” is a feminine word)

d\'{a}i: good
r\'{e}: very (causes ICM on the following word)
in: adverbial marker (causes ICM on the following word)
> in rh\'{e} dh\'{a}i: very well

br\'{a}thu: thank you (thanks)

ti: you
s\'{u}\'{e}: self
> ti-s\'{u}\'{e}: yourself

ach: and

c\'{o}\'{e}th: also, too, as well

gn\'{\i}: to know
gn\'{\i}a ti: you know
a: question particle (causes ICM on the following word)
> a ghn\'{\i}a ti: do you know

o: relative pronoun for subordinate clauses $\rightarrow$ \textit{that, which}; see further below

ti-esi: you have $\rightarrow$ see below

pen: head
tech: beautiful
> pen r\'{e} dech: a very beautiful head

gw\'{e}la ti: you want
p\'{e} a chw\'{e}la ti: what do you want

g\'{a}la mi: I can
a gh\'{a}la mi: can I?

b\'{e}: to cut

prenuchi: to hang

gwer: on

s\'{e}dhl: seat
\'{e}p: horse
> s\'{e}dhl’\'{e}p: saddle (horse-seat)

conechughri: to fuck off (idiomatic expression)

\subsection{Question Formation}

As you can see above questions are made by putting the question particle “a” in front of the verb in the sentence.

gn\'{\i}a ti: you know > statement.
a ghn\'{\i}a ti?: do you know? > question.

The word order doesn't change. The only difference is the question particle \textit{a}. It causes an initial consonant mutation (ICM) on the following word.

g\'{a}la mi: I can > statement.
a gh\'{a}la mi?: can I? > question.

\subsubsection{Question Words}

p\'{e}: what, which
p\'{e} gaman: how
p\'{\i}: who
p\'{e}ri: why
p\'{e}m\'{a}i: where
ponch: when

\subsection{The Verb To Have}

Gal\'{a}thach does not have a specific verb \textit{to have}. Instead it uses a compound construction using the verb \textit{to be}. It is made of the personal pronoun of the entity that \textit{has} something, followed by the verb \textit{to be}. The two are connected with a hyphen.

mi-esi \'{e}p: I have a horse
> mi-esi translates as “with-me, to-me” &gt; mi-esi \'{e}p = “to-me” is a horse

The conjugation is as follows:

mi-esi: I have
ti-esi: you have
\'{e}-esi: he has
\'{\i}-esi: she has
ni-esi: we have
s\'{u}-esi: you (pl.)
s\'{\i}-esi: they have

If the subject of a phrase is specified it comes first, followed by the pronoun+to-be construction.

in gwir: the man
\'{e}-esi: he has
cun: dog
> in gwir \'{e}-esi cun: the man has a dog

in d\'{o}n\'{e}: the people
s\'{\i}-esi: they have
gavr\'{e}: goats
> in d\'{o}n\'{e} s\'{\i}-esi gavr\'{e}: the people have goats

In a question the question particle “a” comes before the pronoun+to-be construction. It causes mutation to the first letter of the construction.

p\'{e} a di-esi: what do you have?
p\'{e}ri a sh\'{u}-esi \'{e}p\'{e}: why do you (pl.) have horses?

In a question where the subject is specified the question particle comes between the subject and the pronoun+to-be construction.

p\'{e}ri in gwir a h\'{e}-esi cun: why does the man have a dog?
p\'{e}ri in d\'{o}n\'{e} a sh\'{\i}-esi gavr\'{e}: why do the people have goats?

\subsection{Subordinate clauses}

A subordinate clause is a sentence inside of another sentence. It has a verb, subject and object that are independent of the main sentence. The two are linked with the particle \textit{o}, which translates in English as \textit{that} or \textit{which}.

gn\'{\i}a ti: you know
o: that
ti-esi: you have
pen: a head
tech: beautiful
> gn\'{\i}a ti \textbf{o} ti-esi pen tech: you know \textbf{that} you have a beautiful head

ap\'{\i}sa mi: I see
o: that
n\'{e} hesi: there is not
curu: beer
\'{e}th: more
> ap\'{\i}sa mi \textbf{o} n\'{e} hesi curu \'{e}th: I see \textbf{that} there is no more beer

In the subordinate clause the second sentence (\textit{there is no more beer}) can stand alone independently from the first one (\textit{I see}). The two are connected by the particle \textit{o}.

If the particle \textit{o} is followed by a word that starts with a vowel it becomes \textit{och}.

gw\'{\i}dha mi: I understand
o: that
esi ti: you are
lisc: tired
> gw\'{\i}dha mi \textbf{och} esi ti lisc: I understand \textbf{that} you are tired
