\subsection{Conversation}
%
%Below is a conversation between two people. Bren is a man, Chiomára is a woman. Both are traditional Gaulish names. Bren was the leader of the attack on Delphi in 279 BCE, Chiomára was a woman from Galatia. This conversation shows you how questions are constructed.

%
%<strong>2. Question Formation</strong>
%
%As you can see above questions are made by putting the question particle “a” in front of the verb in the sentence.
%
%gnía ti: you know &gt; statement.
%a ghnía ti?: do you know? &gt; question.
%
%The word order doesn’t change. The only difference is the question particle “a”. It causes an initial consonant mutation (ICM) on the following word.
%
%gála mi: I can &gt; statement.
%a ghála mi?: can I? &gt; question.
%
%<strong>Question Words</strong>
%
%pé: what, which
%pé gaman: how
%pí: who
%péri: why
%pémái: where
%ponch: when
%
%<strong>3. The Verb To Have</strong>
%
%Galáthach does not have a specific verb “to have”. Instead it uses a compound construction using the verb “to be”. It is made of the personal pronoun of the entity that “has” something, followed by the verb “to be”. The two are connected with a hyphen.
%
%mi-esi ép: I have a horse
%
%&gt; mi-esi translates as “with-me, to-me” &gt; mi-esi ép = “to-me” is a horse
%
%The conjugation is as follows:
%
%mi-esi: I have
%ti-esi: you have
%é-esi: he has
%í-esi: she has
%ni-esi: we have
%sú-esi: you (pl.)
%sí-esi: they have
%
%If the subject of a phrase is specified it comes first, followed by the pronoun+to-be construction.
%
%in gwir: the man
%é-esi: he has
%cun: dog
%&gt; in gwir é-esi cun: the man has a dog
%
%in dóné: the people
%sí-esi: they have
%gavré: goats
%&gt; in dóné sí-esi gavré: the people have goats
%
%In a question the question particle “a” comes before the pronoun+to-be construction. It causes mutation to the first letter of the construction.
%
%pé a di-esi: what do you have?
%péri a shú-esi épé: why do you (pl.) have horses?
%
%In a question where the subject is specified the question particle comes between the subject and the pronoun+to-be construction.
%
%péri in gwir a hé-esi cun: why does the man have a dog?
%péri in dóné a shí-esi gavré: why do the people have goats?

%<strong>4. Subordinate clauses</strong>
%
%A subordinate clause is a sentence inside of another sentence. It has a verb, subject and object that are independent of the main sentence. The two are linked with the particle “o”, which translates in English as “that” or “which”.
%
%gnía ti: you know
%o: that
%ti-esi: you have
%pen: a head
%tech: beautiful
%&gt; gnía ti <strong><u>o</u></strong> ti-esi pen tech: you know <strong><u>that </u></strong>you have a beautiful head
%
%apísa mi: I see
%o: that
%né hesi: there is not
%curu: beer
%éth: more
%&gt; apísa mi <strong><u>o</u></strong> né hesi curu éth: I see <strong><u>that</u></strong> there is no more beer
%
%In the subordinate clause the second sentence (“there is no more beer”) can stand alone independently from the first one (“I see”). The two are connected by the particle “o”.
%
%If the particle “o”is followed by a word that starts with a vowel it becomes “och”.
%
%gwídha mi: I understand
%o: that
%esi ti: you are
%lisc: tired
%&gt; gwídha mi <strong><u>och</u></strong> esi ti lisc: I understand <strong><u>that</u></strong> you are tired
%
